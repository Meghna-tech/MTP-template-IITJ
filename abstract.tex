The M.Sc./M.Sc.-M.Tech./M.Tech. Program of study requires each student to undertake research in the  chosen area of study and to submit a thesis on it in consultation with the faculty member(s) supervising the same. The M.Sc./M.Sc.-M.Tech./M.Tech. Project is included in the curriculum with a view to synthesize the various components of the research work undertaken during the of the M.Sc./M.Sc.-M.Tech./M.Tech. Program at IIT Jodhpur. Creating a Project Report document of the research undertaken is part of the skill building training of the student in technical communications. Here, the emphasis is on presenting a technical matter in an objective written form.

This document is a record of the mandatory guidelines to be followed while preparing the of the Project Report document to be submitted at the end of the M.Sc./M.Sc.-M.Tech./M.Tech. Program. It prescribes typical contents that an M.Sc./M.Sc.-M.Tech./M.Tech. Project Report document usually should contain, and provides the format of its presentation. While most of these guidelines are prescriptive, some are subjective; but towards ensuring a relatively uniform style of presentation of all M.Sc./M.Sc.-M.Tech./M.Tech. Project Report being submitted at the Institute, these subjective guidelines are expected to help in setting at least a reasonable minimum expectation of the presentation level of the work accomplished in the research program.

All students pursuing M.Sc./M.Sc.-M.Tech./M.Tech. Program are urged to read the contents and form of this document carefully, and prepare their Project Report document as prescribed. It is hoped that this document will lead to a modest beginning at the Institute towards imparting education in professional written presentations.
